# DER_Forecast is a website created via Python-Django to forecast the power output of installed solar PV and wind turbines anywhere in the world. This is done by a model created from the Typical Meteorological Year (TMY3) database. The model fetches live weather data from Dark Sky Forecast API and predicts the output of the installed solar and wind energy generators.

# RegressionForSolarClearnessIndex contains the python codes for the regression models to get the solar Clearness Index to predict the output of the solar radiation based on the weather temperature and humidity.
